hi, my name is matthew but people call me matt.
today is january 12 2024 and i just made this account.
my plan or you could say goal right now is to learn how to code,
no matter what language it is (except brainf*ck or assembly).
i dont really know what kind of future to go for, (for example full-stack developer, software engineer, go into AI etc.)
but i am here now and hopefully i will succeed in anything i decide to do, :),
good luck me and everyone else new on this platform.
and idk if this is the place to put an about me but honestly i dont care
